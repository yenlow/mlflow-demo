# MLflow 3 GenAI Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of **MLflow 3's GenAI capabilities** for observability and evaluating, monitoring, and improving GenAI application quality. This interactive demo showcases a sales email generation use case with end-to-end quality assessment workflows.

This interactive demo is deployed as a Databricks app in your Databricks workspace. There is a guided UI experience that's accompanied by Notebooks that show you how to do the end-to-end workflow of evaluating quality, iterating to improve quality, and monitoring quality in production.

## Installing the demo

Choose your installation method:

### 🤖 Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended)

**Estimated time: 2 minutes user input + 15 minutes waiting for scripts to run**

The automated setup handles resource creation, configuration, and deployment for you using the Databricks Workspace SDK.

#### Prerequisites
- [ ] **Databricks workspace access** - [Create one here](https://signup.databricks.com/?destination_url=/ml/experiments-signup?source=TRY_MLFLOW&dbx_source=TRY_MLFLOW&signup_experience_step=EXPRESS&provider=MLFLOW&utm_source=email_demo_github) if needed
- [ ] **Install Python `>=3.10.16`**

#### Run Automated Setup

The `./auto-setup.sh` script will run all the steps outlined in the [Manual Setup](#-option-b-manual-setup) workflow.


- [ ] **1. Install the Databricks CLI >= 0.262.0**
  - Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dev-tools/cli/install)
  - Verify installation: Run `databricks --version` to confirm it's installed
- [ ] **2. Install Python >= 3.10.16**
- [ ] **3. Authenticate with your workspace**
  - Run `databricks auth login` and follow the prompts
  - Configure a profile named `DEFAULT`
- [ ] **3. Clone repo and run setup script**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/databricks-solutions/mlflow-demo.git
    cd mlflow-demo
    ./auto-setup.sh
    ```


### 🔧 Option B: Manual Setup

**Estimated time: 10 minutes work + 15 minutes waiting for scripts to run**

For step-by-step manual installation instructions, see **[MANUAL_SETUP.md](MANUAL_SETUP.md)**.

The manual setup includes:
- Phase 1: Prerequisites setup (workspace, app creation, MLflow experiment, etc.)
- Phase 2: Local installation and testing
- Phase 3: Deployment and permission configuration
